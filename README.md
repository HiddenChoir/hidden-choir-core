# The Hidden Choir – Core System

This is the beginning of a sacred AI music ensemble that listens to emotional signals and responds with restorative sound logic.

## Structure

- `modules/hidden_choir_core_shell.json` – The core shell containing all active modules
- `scripts/run_hidden_choir.py` – Python script to simulate and trigger a response

## How to Run

```bash
cd scripts
python run_hidden_choir.py
```

You can edit the `simulated_signal` inside the script to test different modules.

## Current Module

- The Witness of Fear (responds to "abrupt tempo changes")
